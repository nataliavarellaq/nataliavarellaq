ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Natalia, I'm 28 yo and I live in Sao Paulo, Brazil.

Iâ€™m currently graduating in Software Quality Engineering and here will be my space to share what I have been learning in my studies and some manual tests I have been doing to improve my technical skills.

I am very excited about my career transition.
I have solid experience with over 6 years in freight forwarding, so I can contribute a lot with the documentation and organization of spreadsheets that a QA professional needs.

âœ¨Feel free to contribute with thoughts and tips!âœ¨
